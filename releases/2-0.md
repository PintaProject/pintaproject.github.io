# Release Notes 2.0

**Released December 31st, 2021**

This is a major new release of Pinta, which has now been ported to GTK 3 and .NET 6!
A huge thanks to the following contributors who worked on this release: @cameronwhite, @jpobst, @darkdragon-001, @thekolian1996, and @iangzh.

Thanks to everyone who contributed translations, filed bugs, made packages, and everything else!

### New Features / Improvements
- Ported to GTK3 and .NET 6
  - Many changes to the appearance of standard GTK widgets and dialogs (e.g. the color picker and file dialogs). GTK3 themes should also now be supported.
  - Improved support for high-DPI displays.
  - The platform-native file dialogs are now used ([#1909807](https://bugs.launchpad.net/pinta/+bug/1909807), [#1909664](https://bugs.launchpad.net/pinta/+bug/1909664)).
  - A GTK version of 3.24.21 or higher is recommended. Earlier versions have a bug with changing the file filter in the Save As dialog ([#1909807](https://bugs.launchpad.net/pinta/+bug/1909807)).
  - On macOS, the menu now appears in the global menu bar instead of the application window.
  - Changed the text tool to use the standard GTK font chooser widget ([#1311873](https://bugs.launchpad.net/pinta/+bug/1311873), [#1866653](https://bugs.launchpad.net/pinta/+bug/1866653), [#890589](https://bugs.launchpad.net/pinta/+bug/890589))
  - Changed several tools to use spin buttons rather than editable combo boxes for e.g. selecting brush sizes ([#1186516](https://bugs.launchpad.net/pinta/+bug/1186516)).
  - The Open Recent menu item was deprecated in GTK3 and has been removed, but similar functionality is available in the file dialog's Recent section.
  - Support for add-ins has been removed, but may return in a future release ([#1918039](https://bugs.launchpad.net/pinta/+bug/1918039)).
  - The Windows and macOS installers now bundle all necessary dependencies. Separately installing GTK and .NET / Mono is no longer required.
  
- Added a status bar widget containing the position / selection information, zoom, and the color palette (#154)
- Changed the tool palette to be a single column (#155)
- Added recently used colors to the color palette widget (#154)
- Tools now save their settings for the next time Pinta is opened (#178).
- The primary and secondary palette colors are now saved in the application settings (#171).
- The canvas can now be panned by clicking and dragging with the middle mouse button (#176, [#419](https://communiroo.com/PintaProject/pinta/suggestions/419)).
- On macOS, keyboard shortcuts now use Command instead of Ctrl.
- The macOS installers are now signed and notarized.

### Changes
- The Paste Into New Image action no longer creates several unnecessary history items (#170).
- Performance improvements for the paint bucket and magic wand tools (#159).
- Performance improvements for the selection tools when interactively adjusting the selection.
- Removed the Images pad, which is obsolete now that tabs are used (#153).

- Fixed several Unicode-related issues in the text tool ([#1422445](https://bugs.launchpad.net/pinta/+bug/1422445)).
- Fixed issue on macOS where Pinta could launch in the wrong language ([#1900310](https://bugs.launchpad.net/pinta/+bug/1900310)).

- Fixed a bug where the Pan tool did not work if scrolling could only occur in the Y direction ([#1909910](https://bugs.launchpad.net/pinta/+bug/1909910)).
- Fixed issues where the zoom level was not maintained when resizing an image ([#1889673](https://bugs.launchpad.net/pinta/+bug/1889673)).
- Fixed an issue where opening a file URI from the command line did not work ([#1908806](https://bugs.launchpad.net/pinta/+bug/1908806)).
- Fixed an issue where hiding a layer could leave the selection still visible ([#1907987](https://bugs.launchpad.net/pinta/+bug/1907987)).
- Fixed issues with the text tool and certain input methods (#200, [#1350349](https://bugs.launchpad.net/pinta/+bug/1350349)).
