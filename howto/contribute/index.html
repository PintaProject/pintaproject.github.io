        <h2>Bug Reports &amp; Feature Requests</h2>
        <p>One way to contribute to Pinta without writing code is to file bugs
          when things don’t work. Bug reports let developers know what needs
          to be fixed in Pinta. Or if you have a great idea for a new feature
          for Pinta, we’ve got a place where you can submit your ideas and vote
          on which ones should be implemented.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://github.com/PintaProject/Pinta/issues">Pinta Bug Tracker</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://github.com/PintaProject/Pinta/discussions/categories/ideas">Pinta Feature Requests</a></li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Translations</h2>
        <p>Another way to contribute to Pinta without writing a line of code is
          to translate Pinta into a new language. This is all done through a
          web page, so all you need to know is a second language.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://hosted.weblate.org/engage/pinta/">Pinta Translation Page</a></li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Patches and Fixes</h2>
        <p>If you are interested in contributing to the core of Pinta, like to
          fix a bug or tweak existing code, you’ll want to make your changes
          available as pull requests on GitHub. Using Git is an important part
          of contributing to Pinta, so if you want to read up on this we
          recommend reading the excellent documentation on GitHub, or if you
          want an even deeper understanding read <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2">Pro Git</a>.
        </p>
        <p>The source code for Pinta development is available on
          <a href="https://github.com/PintaProject/Pinta">PintaProject GitHub</a>.
        </p>
        <h3>Fixing a Bug</h3>
        <p>If you plan to work on a bug that has been registered on our
          <a href="https://github.com/PintaProject/Pinta/issues">Launchpad page</a>,
          then go to the relevant bug and make sure no one
          else is already working on it, then leave a comment saying that
          you are working on it.
        </p>
        <h3>Creating a Pinta Fork</h3>
        <p>First you need to make yourself an account with GitHub if you
          haven’t already got one. It is recommended that you use your full
          name, because we need something to put in the credits! Then you
          fork the <a href="https://github.com/PintaProject/Pinta">PintaProject Repository</a>,
          and pull the code down to your local machine.
          (All explained <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo">on this page.</a>.)
        </p>
        <h3>Writing, Compiling and Testing</h3>
        <p>This is where the magic happens! Make whatever changes are necessary
          to the source code, but please do not attempt to clean up existing
          code. We are only interested in seeing functional changes to the
          code, if they are mixed with cosmetic changes it becomes very
          difficult to see what has actually changed. Build your code
          according to the <a href="https://github.com/PintaProject/Pinta/blob/master/readme.md">building instructions</a>,
          and test it to make sure it does what it’s supposed to and doesn’t do
          anything it’s not supposed to.
        </p>
        <h3>Committing your Fix</h3>
        <p>When you are satisfied that you have a great fix to share with the
          world, commit it to your GitHub fork. (See the second part of
          <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/create-a-repo">Create A Repo</a>.) Make sure that the commit message
          includes the bug number and a short description, this is vital so
          that the developers know what exactly they are looking at. Then it
          will be publicly visible for scrutiny, which comes in handy for the
          next step.
        </p>
        <h3>Sending a GitHub Pull Request</h3>
        <p>
          Pull requests are thoroughly explained
          <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests">in this doc</a>.
          You will want to send a pull request to the Pinta repository from your
          fork. When the developers see your request, they will test your
          solution and if it is good they will merge it into the Pinta source
          code. They will then close the bug on Launchpad and add your name to
          the credits as a contributor, and you get a lovely warm feeling
          inside from helping make the world a better place!
