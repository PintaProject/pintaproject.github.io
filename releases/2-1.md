### New Features / Improvements
- Updated icons to symbolic SVG icons, which are more usable for dark themes and high-res screens (#204, #207, [#1738106](https://bugs.launchpad.net/pinta/+bug/1738106), [#1909573](https://bugs.launchpad.net/pinta/+bug/1909573))
- Added "Transparency Mode" to the Gradient tool
- The selection move handles and shape control point handles are now much easier to use when working on zoomed in or small images (#211, #223, [#1173756](https://bugs.launchpad.net/pinta/+bug/1173756), [#1958924](https://bugs.launchpad.net/pinta/+bug/1958924), [#1958920](https://bugs.launchpad.net/pinta/+bug/1958920))
- The File -> New Screenshot command now uses the XDG screenshot portal if available. This fixes issues with taking screenshots under Wayland (#218, [#1955841](https://bugs.launchpad.net/pinta/+bug/1955841))
- Improved canvas rendering performance (#209, #210)
- Added support for loading files from virtual filesystems such as Google Drive mounts (#215, [#1958763](https://bugs.launchpad.net/pinta/+bug/1958763))
- Improved support for `.ora` files
  - Hidden layers are now round-tripped correctly for `.ora` files ([#1377566](https://bugs.launchpad.net/pinta/+bug/1377566))
  - When saving a `.ora` file, a flattened image (`mergedimage.png`) is now included in the archive. This is required by the spec to accomodate viewer software ([#1377566](https://bugs.launchpad.net/pinta/+bug/1377566))
- Image or palette files that have an unknown extension but have valid contents can now be loaded ([#1679570](https://bugs.launchpad.net/pinta/+bug/1679570))
  - The file dialog also now uses MIME types on Linux and macOS, allowing valid image files with unknown extensions to be included in the image file filter (#216)
- Updated the application icon (#220)
- WebP support
  - For Linux users, [webp-pixbuf-loader](https://github.com/aruiz/webp-pixbuf-loader/) is now a suggested dependency to enable WebP support in Pinta
  - `webp-pixbuf-loader` is now included with the macOS package for WebP support. This is not yet included with other packages, such as Snap, Flatpak, and the Windows installer.
- Upgraded to .NET 7
  - Building against .NET 6 (LTS) is still supported. When building from the tarball, .NET 6 will be used if .NET 7 is unavailable

### Changes
- Pinta now uses the standard GTK about dialog
- The Line / Curve tool no longer requires pressing Ctrl to start drawing a shape when the mouse is outside the canvas ([#1999997](https://bugs.launchpad.net/pinta/+bug/1999997))

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed a bug where the default linear gradient was reflected rather than clamped
- The gradient tool now updates correctly when drawing transparent colors. Previously, old results were visible under the transparent color ([#1937942](https://bugs.launchpad.net/pinta/+bug/1937942))
- The history panel is now more readable when a dark theme is used (#207)
- Fixed an issue where the Cairo surface for live effect previews was not always disposed (#206)
- Fixed errors that could occur if a selection existed but had zero area (e.g. after inverting a full selection) ([#1754440](https://bugs.launchpad.net/pinta/+bug/1754440))
- Fixed an issue on Windows where the ruler's text did not render correctly (#212)
- Fixed a regression from Pinta 2.0 where the rulers did not draw a marker for the current mouse position (#214)
- Improved the zoom tool's rectangle zoom when working with smaller images
- Fixed a potential crash when opening / adding an image after actions in the layer list panel ([#1959598](https://bugs.launchpad.net/pinta/+bug/1959598))
- Fixed an issue where the "All Files" filter in the Open File dialog ignored files with no extension, and did not work in the macOS native file chooser ([#1958670](https://bugs.launchpad.net/pinta/+bug/1958670), [#1679570](https://bugs.launchpad.net/pinta/+bug/1679570))
- Fixed a crash in the text tool when pressing Ctrl+X without a selection (#219, [#1964398](https://bugs.launchpad.net/pinta/+bug/1964398))
- The application icon now appears correctly on KDE Wayland sessions [#1967687](https://bugs.launchpad.net/pinta/+bug/1967687)
- Fixed an issue where the selection could be invalid after undoing a rotation [#1975864](https://bugs.launchpad.net/pinta/+bug/1975864)
- Fixed a bug where the selected layer could be changed while updating the layer list widget [#1965101](https://bugs.launchpad.net/pinta/+bug/1965101)
- Fixed a bug in the shape tools where changing the shape type did not always take effect (#235, #238, [#1993332](https://bugs.launchpad.net/pinta/+bug/1993332), [#1635902](https://bugs.launchpad.net/pinta/+bug/1635902))
- Fixed an issue on macOS where toolbar drop down button menus items could not be selected properly
- Pinta now always saves files to the exact file name chosen by the native file dialog, without e.g. appending a default extension. This fixes issues where files saved through desktop portals could be lost ([#1958670](https://bugs.launchpad.net/pinta/+bug/1958670))
- Fixed a bug where an empty dash pattern resulted in nothing being drawn ([#1973706](https://bugs.launchpad.net/pinta/+bug/1973706))
- Fixed issues where certain dash patterns did not draw correctly ([#1959032](https://bugs.launchpad.net/pinta/+bug/1959032))
- Fixed a bug where pasting into a new image could occasionally zoom the new image to 1% ([#1959673](https://bugs.launchpad.net/pinta/+bug/1959673))
