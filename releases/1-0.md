# Release Notes 1.0

**Released April 27th, 2011**

Pinta has finally hit 1.0!  Thanks to everyone who sent encouragement, bugs, translations, and patches!

This release fixes the last few major bugs reported throughout the beta cycle.

## Next Steps

In the next month or so I'll get a new roadmap up of my ideas for Pinta's development.

We also have a shiny new feature request site where you can submit and vote on new features for Pinta, so dive in and help shape the future of Pinta:
