pintaproject.github.io
======================

Files for the the github.io website. (Currently only work-in-progress!)

The plan is for this to become the new Pinta homepage (redirected from the standard URL), which will save on hosting costs.
It will be updated with markdown through GitHub Pages's Jekyll system.
