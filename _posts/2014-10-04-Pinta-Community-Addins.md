#Pinta Community Addins
We have replaced our old and slightly unreliable addin server with a new, simple method base on github pages. Check it out [https://github.com/PintaProject/Pinta-Community-Addins](on github)! In future Pinta releases this repository will be included in the addin manager, if you want to see it in action right now you can add it through your addin manager using this URL: http://pintaproject.github.io/Pinta-Community-Addins/repository .
