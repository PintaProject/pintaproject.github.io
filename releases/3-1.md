### Changed
- Packaging changes
  - Updated dependencies to require GTK 4.18+ and libadwaita 1.7+
  - Pinta now consistently uses an application ID of `com.github.PintaProject.Pinta`, which previously had been applied in patches for downstream packages (#1706, #1419)
- Breaking API changes for add-ins will require add-ins to be rebuilt against Pinta 3.1
  - Attributes used for effect configuration properties (`CaptionAttribute`, `MaximumValueAttribute`, ...) are now in the `Pinta.Core` assembly and the `Pinta.Core` namespace (#1665)
  - Methods `RegisterEffect`, `UnregisterInstanceOfEffect`, `RegisterAdjustment`, and `UnregisterInstanceOfAdjustment` in `EffectsManager` are now generic (#1678)

- View menu moved from hamburger menu to dedicated button (#1428, #1471)
- Updated the application icon on macOS to better match the platform's icon style guidelines (#1572)
