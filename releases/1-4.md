# Release Notes 1.4

**Released September 27, 2012**

Thanks to everyone who has contributed, Pinta is now at v1.4!

## New Features / Improvements
* Magic Wand tool selection modes (Union, Exclude, Xor, and Intersect).
* Layer blend modes.
* Reduced memory usage in the Open Images Pad (over 100mb in some cases).
* Significantly reduced memory usage for history (only the difference between
  the two images is stored)
* Copy/Paste support for the text tool.
* Improved rendering performance.
* The colour picker tool now supports different sampling sizes, and sampling
from a single layer or the entire image.
* Improved support for special characters and alternate input methods in the
text tool.
* Added a Copy Merged command to copy the flattened image/selection to the
clipboard, instead of just the current layer.
* Added a drop shadow to the canvas.
* Improved support for extensions:
* Extensions can be initialized/uninitialized properly, including removing
any tools/effects that were registered.
* Downloads from remote repositories are now enabled.
