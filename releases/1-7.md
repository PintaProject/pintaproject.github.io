- Added a Smooth Erase tool, which is enabled using the Type menu on the Erase tool's toolbar (#110).
- The Pencil tool can switch between different blend modes (#124, [#1688743](https://bugs.launchpad.net/pinta/+bug/1688743)).
- Added support for JASC PaintShop Pro palette files (#126).
- The transform tools can now rotate in fixed increments by holding Shift (#134).
- The Move Selected tool can now scale by holding Ctrl (#138).
- Dragging and dropping a URL (e.g. image from a web browser) to download and open the image is now supported (#80, [#644123](https://bugs.launchpad.net/pinta/+bug/644123)). 
- Performance improvements when interacting with selections, particularly for large images ([#1428740](https://bugs.launchpad.net/pinta/+bug/1428740)).
- The Rectangle Select tool now shows different arrow cursors at each corner of the selection ([#1188143](https://bugs.launchpad.net/pinta/+bug/1188143)).

### Changes
- .NET 4.5 / Mono 4.0 are now required.
- Mono 6.x is strongly recommended for [Mac](https://www.mono-project.com/download/stable/#download-mac) and [Linux](https://bugs.launchpad.net/pinta/+bug/1877235) users.
- UI improvements to the New Image dialog (#99, [[1424547](https://bugs.launchpad.net/pinta/+bug/1424547)).
- The Rotate / Zoom dialog now rotates in-place instead of changing the layer's size.
- Cairo blend operations are now used instead of PDN's managed blend modes (#98, [#1248933](https://bugs.launchpad.net/pinta/+bug/1248933), [#1091910](https://bugs.launchpad.net/pinta/+bug/1091910)).
- The tool windows can now only be closed with the View -> Tool Windows menu, as it was easy to accidentally close them without knowing how to recover them ([#1428720](https://bugs.launchpad.net/pinta/+bug/1428720)).
- The shortcut for the Intersect selection mode is now Alt + Left Click instead of using Shift, which had caused conflicts with holding Shift to constrain the selection to a square ([#1426660](https://bugs.launchpad.net/pinta/+bug/1426660)).
