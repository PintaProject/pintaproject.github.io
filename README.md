pintaproject.github.io
======================

Files for the the github.io website. (Currently only work-in-progress!)

The plan is for this to become the new Pinta homepage (redirected from the standard URL), which will save on hosting costs.
It will be updated with markdown through GitHub Pages's Jekyll system.


###SparkleShare

You might notice some files named SparkleShare and a large number of automated-looking commits, that's because I'll be trying
out using SparkleShare to automatically sync all changes made, which will basically mean that the website will evolve
live as I make changes. Should be interesting!
